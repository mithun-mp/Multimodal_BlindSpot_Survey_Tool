## 3. Original Sentence Baselines (Evaluated Once Per Model)
| Model | Seed Sentence | Type | Predicted Label | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` | "The movie was great and the acting was t..." | `LITERAL` | **POSITIVE** | 0.9999 (100.0%) |

## 4. Primary Research Metrics
| Model | Probes | Observed Flips (Rate) | Expected Flips (Rate) | Expected Preserves (Rate) | Consistency | ECE | Mean Δ (pp) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` | 7 | 1 (14.3%) | 0/2 (28.6%) | 5/5 (100.0%) | 85.7% | 0.1402 | -0.3 pp |

## 5. Behavioral Failure Taxonomy Counts (Never Suppressed)
| Model | Blind | Spurious | Misweighted | Undetermined | Compliant (None) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 |

## 7. Pipeline Count Integrity Audit
| Model | Generated | Selected | Verified | Planned | Executed | Analyzed | Reported | Audit Result |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | **PASS** |

## 8. Semantic Reference Methodology & Ground-Truth Alignment
1. **Canonical Semantic Label Space**: Ground-truth polarity is strictly confined to `POSITIVE`, `NEGATIVE`, and `NEUTRAL`. Non-canonical sentiment categories (such as `MIXED`, `AMBIGUOUS`, `SARCASTIC`) are rejected.
2. **Google Gemini Role**: Gemini operates exclusively as an external semantic annotator/verification layer for baseline and probe sentences. It is **never** a benchmark model, does not forecast model failures, and is strictly prohibited from generating the failure taxonomy.
3. **Human Verification & Override**: Every semantic reference can be verified and overridden by researchers (`[Accept]` / `[Change]`). Frozen semantic references are strictly immutable during model evaluation.
4. **Binary vs. Multiclass Alignment**: Binary models (e.g. 2-class SST-2) natively output `NEGATIVE` and `POSITIVE`. When semantic reference is `NEUTRAL`, binary models' forced polarity is recorded as `NOT_DIRECTLY_REPRESENTABLE` (`BINARY_FORCED_POLARITY`), preserving empirical truth rather than falsely modifying the reference.
5. **Independence of Model Outputs & Rule-Based Taxonomy**: Model predictions remain 100% empirical forward-pass outputs. The failure taxonomy (`Blind`, `Spurious`, `Misweighted`, `Undetermined`) is derived purely by deterministic rule-based behavioral analysis, completely independent of Gemini.
